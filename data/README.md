Cluster_data.txt contains cluster statistics obtained from the simulated trajectory files. This data contributes to Figures 7 and S1. It contains the PEG fraction, trial #, configuration #, the number of DDT found in the clusters, the fraction of the surface covered by the DDT clusters, the number of PEG found in PEG clusters, the fraction of the surface covered by the PEG clusters, and the total fraction of surface covered by the monolayer.

Core_sizes.txt contains the TEM/STEM-measured nanoparticle core sizes presented in the core size distribution (Figure 2b).

Experimental_ssrs.txt contains the experimental MALDI-MS and subsequent SSR calculation data. The data within this file contributes to Figures 4 and 5. It contains the calculated SSR, fragment distributions, and PEG/DDT surface fractions obtained experimentally.

Janus_fragment_distributions.txt contains the fragment distributions and average SSR values (with standard deviation) from a strictly Janus set of monolayers (no relaxation was performed) across the range of PEG fractions studied (0.1-0.9). This data contributes to Figures 1 and 6.

Simulation_ssr_n_fragments.txt contains the SSR and fragment distributions from every sample performed during the analysis of the simulated trajectories. This data contributes to Figures 1, 4, 5, and 6. The file contains the number of DDT and PEG at each surface fraction, initial configuration set, the trial number (each trial had the final 10 snapshots sampled -- hence, the multiple entries for seemingly the same trial and initial config), the corresponding binomial distribution for the surface fraction, computationally-determined fragment distributions, and SSR values after comparison to the binomial distribution.

uv_vis_data.txt contains the UV-Vis data presented in Figure S2.
