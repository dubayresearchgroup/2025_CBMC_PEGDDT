This repo contains the data and analysis scripts for the publication "Engineering Nanoparticle Surface Amphiphilicity: An Integrated Computational and Laser Desorption Ionization Study of Controlled Ligand Self-Assembly."

The subdirectory "data" contains text files (and 1 excel file) of data found experimentally and generated during the analysis of the Configurationally Biased Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations. 

The subdirectory "figures" contains the analysis script related to each figure reported in the manuscript along with the corresponding data files for clarity. Note that many of the analysis scripts are written to parse xyz trajectory files as input for the calculations rather than to read the data in text files (provided in the "data" folder). The data files provided are produced during the analysis. 

More information on the CBMC model can be found at https://github.com/zlafa24/np-mc.git.
