This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the publication "Engineering Nanoparticle Surface Amphiphilicity: An Integrated Computational and Laser Desorption Ionization Study of Controlled Ligand Self-Assembly."

The subdirectory "data" contains text files containing data obtained experimentally and computationally during the analysis of the Configurationally Biased Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations of 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol and dodecanethiol decorated ultrasmall Au nanoparticles. 

The subdirectory "figures" contains the analysis script related to each figure reported in the manuscript along with the corresponding data files for clarity. Note that many of the analysis scripts are written to parse xyz trajectory files as input for the calculations, as was done during the analysis, rather than to read in and plot the data presented in text files (provided in the "data" folder). The data files provided were produced during the analysis. 

More information on the CBMC model can be found at https://github.com/zlafa24/np-mc.git.
