This repo contains the data and analysis scripts for the publication "Engineering Nanoparticle Surface Amphiphilicity: An Integrated Computational and Laser Desorption Ionization Study of Controlled Ligand Self-Assembly."

The subdirectory "data" contains text files (and 1 excel file) of columnated data generated during the analysis of the Configurationally Biased Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations. 

The subdirectory "figures" contains the analysis script related to each figure reported in the manuscript along with the corresponding data files for clarity.

More information on the CBMC model can be found at https://github.com/zlafa24/np-mc.git.
